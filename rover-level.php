                <p>Rover Scouts, Rovers, Rover Scouting or Rovering is a program associated with some Scouting
                    organizations
                    for adult men and women. A group of Rovers is called a 'Rover Crew'.

                    Rovers was originated by The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom in 1918 to provide a
                    program
                    for young men who had grown up beyond the age range of the Boy Scouts. It was adopted by many other
                    Scouting organisations.

                    Many Scouting organisations, including The Scout Association in the UK, no longer include a Rover
                    program. Some have replaced it with other programs while others, including Traditional Scouting
                    organisations, maintain the original program. The Baden-Powell Award still forms the Rover award
                    scheme
                    in associations in several countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, India,
                    Pakistan, Hong Kong and Singapore, and for several of the traditional Scouting associations that
                    retained Rover Scouting. </p>
