        <p>Cub Scouts, Cubs or Wolf Cubs are programs associated with Scouting for young children usually between 7
          and 12, depending on the organization to which they belong. A participant in the program is called a Cub. A
          group of Cubs is called a 'Pack'.

          The Wolf Cub program was originated by The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom in 1916 to provide a
          program for boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts. It was adopted by many other Scouting organizations.
          Many Scouting organizations, including The Scout Association, no longer use the Wolf Cub program and have
          replaced it with other programs but have retained the name Cubs. Others, including Traditional Scouting
          organizations, maintain the original Wolf Cubs program.

          Originally Cubs programs were open only to boys, while young girls could join the Brownies. Some Cub
          organizations are open to both girls and boys, although not necessarily in the same unit. Below cub's robes
