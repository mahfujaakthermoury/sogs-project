                <p>Scouting, also known as the Scout Movement, is a worldwide youth movement employing the Scout method,
                    a
                    program of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including camping,
                    woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports. Another widely recognized movement
                    characteristic
                    is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and
                    encouraging
                    equality, with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia
                    include
                    the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, as well as merit badges and other patches.

                    In 1907, Robert Baden-Powell, a Lieutenant General in the British Army, held a Scouting encampment
                    on
                    Brownsea Island in England. Baden-Powell wrote Scouting for Boys (London, 1908), partly based on his
                    earlier military books. The Scout Movement of both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts was well established
                    in
                    the first decade of the twentieth century. Later, programs for younger children, such as Wolf Cubs
                    (1916), now Cubs, and for older adolescents, such as Rovers (1918), were adopted by some Scout
                    organizations. In 1910, Baden-Powell formed the Girl Guides, for girls in the United Kingdom which
                    spread internationally as Girl Guides and includes age programs of (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and
                    Girl
                    Scout, Ranger Guide). </p>
